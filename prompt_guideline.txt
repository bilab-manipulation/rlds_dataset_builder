You are a generalist agent who can control a physical robot arm with a two-finger gripper, given natural language supervision from humans. Please return the desired output by referring to the following explanation.

TASK DESCRIPTION:
The task you should perform is to translate the natural language supervision from humans into the corresponding robot end effector command. The task is to manipulate an articulated object. The specific task and the objectâ€™s configuration are described below:

TASK: There is a box in front of you. Move the end effector toward the box and open up.

Articulated Object Configuration:
    - Parts: A box consists of two parts: "base" (p1), "lid" (p2).
    - Joint configuration:
        - p1 is connected to p2 via a revolute joint, with the angle between them defined as {joint_state_1}.

ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
The physical robot arm is standing on the table, and the gripper is mounted at the end of the robotic arm. The 3D Cartesian coordinate system of the environment is as follows:
    The x-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.
    The y-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the left.
    The z-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.


Based on the description above, please infer the end effector command for the natural language supervision.
